# F1-Simulation

A MATLAB-based simulation that models the movement of a Formula 1 car on a track, with aerodynamic resistance.

This project was developed in **October 2022**

## Features

- Simulates the motion of a Formula 1 car on a track defined by a cubic equation.
- Accounts for **aerodynamic resistance** using drag coefficient, frontal area, and car velocity.
- Displays **animated trajectories** of the car along the track.
- **Tangent line visualization**: Shows the direction of motion at each point of the car’s path.
- Real-time updates of the car’s **speed**, **resistance**, and **power**.
- Simulates **off-track trajectory** in case the car loses control.

## Simulation

Here is an example of the simulation in action:

## Usage

1. Run the script `f1.m` in MATLAB.
2. The program will display the track and the Formula 1 car's path.
3. The simulation will dynamically visualize the **tangent line** at each point of the car's trajectory, helping you understand the direction of motion.
